# widget-tinyg
The TinyG widget subscribes and publishes to the SPJS widget (com-chilipeppr-widget-serialport) and intermediates the serial data to and from the TinyG. This widget parses the incoming data to normalize it for sending off axes reports, onExecuted signals, etc. This widget also allows monitoring of the status of the TinyG as well as configuring it.
